a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application

## Overview

Project: Leviathan is a goal and strength tracker specifically geared toward the niche of the power lifting community. With most fitness popular fitness trackers of the modern web largely geared toward the idea of losing weight and shrinking down, the strength community, mainly focused on mass increase and power gain, has been largely left in "the stone age." Project: Leviathan looks to help solve that problem. Offering tracking, forums, and news geared specifically toward the power lifting community. Project: Leviathan helps to bring one of the longest standing traditional iron sports into the modern age.

### Conceptualization

Project: Leviathan is a mobile first application. It is focused on users who are in the gym and training. Many lifters want to track as they go, especially when coming off of the platform during a meet/competition. Making it mobile first, ensures that a user is always able to record their scores on their chalkboard as soon as they are available after they've made their attempt. It also allows users to post to the forum on while in the gym, allowing the community to post immediate responses to any questions or critiques, especially on videos regarding form during a lift.
